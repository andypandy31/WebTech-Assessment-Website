        <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="text"> You crest the top step and pause as you see the beasts drag the people off to the side of the large hall that the stairs lead to. Noticing the shadow that lay over the stair case, you slowly make your way lightly out the door, finding that you stand under the shadow of a stair case. As you wait for a gap or way out, you hear a clear voice cracking across the hall, far different from the barly, coherent grunting that the beasts used. After a moment, you hear footsteps above you as something walks down the stairs. A large jet-black wing appears first over the side, causing you to press up against the wall. Then a bat-like face of a demon in a suit leans over the side, demanding they move the people to the side room. As he reaches the ground floor, he follows behind them, constantly berating them as it enters with the beasts into a side room with the slam of a door.</div>
            <div class="option1">Option1: Wait longer still you are cenrtain that there is no one else you are unaware of.</div>
            <div class="option2">Option2: You see the main door is only across the hall and run for it the second the sound of the slamed door stops echoing throught the hall</div>
