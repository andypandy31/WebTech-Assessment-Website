            <div class="text">You reach the door and realise it is slightly ajar. You peek through the gap and see nothing, and with a slight push similar to the first door, it swings open with no sound and far too smooth a motion for it to not be well maintained. You step inside, seeing more of the room. Now there are some cages and a stair case carved into the wall, just like in the first room you awoke in. After a few minutes of investigation, you find nothing more and head back to the door, but before you can open it, you hear sounds of grunting. As you slowly open the door and peer, you see what appears to be three beast men and a large dog with two people chained and cuffed being pulled along behind them.</div>
            <div class="option1">Option1: Follow the beasts slowly up the stairs makeing sure they are up and gone before heading up yourself. </div>
            <div class="option2">Option2: Head to the first cell where you awoke in an attempt to try and find where the beasts had come from as you had seen or hear nothing before.</div>
