            <div class="text">You awaken, slowly searching your surroundings. You are in a cell or large cage of some kind. It is dark, but small hints of light in the room allow for a modicum of sight. The room is empty and so quiet that you feel as if your breath is giving your position away to anything in the room. With a quick examination of the cage, it is locked with an extremely rusted and bent bolt lock.</div>
            <div class="option1">Option1: Kick the cage at the lock in an attempt to bust the locked cage's door open.</div>
            <div class="option2">Option2: Wait in the cage for something to happen to hear something or see something.</div>
            <div class="option3">Option3: Take a moment to unbolt the lock for the cage by putting your fingers throught the gaps and pushing the bolt open.</div>
