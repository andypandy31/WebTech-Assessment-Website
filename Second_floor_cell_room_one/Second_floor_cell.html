            <div class="text">You crest the top of the stair you find your self in a much smaller room filled with cages stacked high and close, with a bit of exporation you conclude that the small room was not so small but a maze of cages leading nowhere, just a storage room. However as you come to a end of your exploration you hear very low tone grunting a chuffing and the sound of metal clanking and tinging as something moved up the stairs.</div>
            <div class="option1">Option1: Hide from what come in the shadows waiting for a chance to run.</div>
            <div class="option2">Option2: Grab a poll or bar from an unassembiled cage and wait right at the entrence to wrap the poll over the head of whatever comes through.</div>
